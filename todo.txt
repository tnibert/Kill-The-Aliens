These are the outstanding tasks that I'd like to do:

# fix windows nuitka build
#
# power up spawn and InvaderBossBehave shooting probabilities are frame rate dependent
# --- use Timer instead
#
# there was a bug observed where player did not appear on the second level
# but was not able to reproduce
#
# yield points for getting status modifiers
# add ability for some saucers to shoot
# add easy, medium, hard difficulty options
# Ensure initial saucers spawn off screen
# normalize ship diagonal movement
# --- this is causing us to overtake bullets when we have both more guns and speed up statmod enabled
# Replace health texts with health bars
# Create 5 levels in total (nasa has free images)
# Change window icon (to not pygame icon)
